# Time Talker

Time Talker is an Android app that speaks the time.

You'll need to enable this by launching the app. Make sure your ringer is on.
After the screen turns on, shake your phone within a few seconds and your phone
will speak the time. You might have to wait a bit as Android's TextToSpeech may
take a while to initialize.
